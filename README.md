# 🔍 vibe-sec

**Security scanner for indie developers and vibe coders.**

You built something cool with AI. You deployed it fast. But do you know what's exposed?
`vibe-sec` scans your public GitHub repos and web endpoints from the outside — just like an attacker would.

Runs on **Cloudflare Workers** (free tier). No server, no setup, no $500/month enterprise plan.

---

## What it finds

| Check | What it catches |
|---|---|
| 🔑 **Secret scanner** | API keys, tokens, passwords accidentally committed to GitHub |
| 📁 **Sensitive files** | `.env`, `credentials.json`, private keys, SQL dumps exposed in repos |
| 🌐 **Endpoint scanner** | `/.env`, `/.git/config`, `/admin`, `/backup.sql` — paths that shouldn't be public |
| 🤖 **AI interface probe** | Prompt injection, system prompt leaks, token extraction on your public chatbots |
| 🔒 **Security headers** | Missing HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options |
| 📜 **Suspicious commits** | Commit messages suggesting accidental secret pushes |

Patterns it detects: AWS keys, OpenAI/Anthropic keys, GitHub tokens, Stripe keys, Telegram bot tokens, Google API keys, DB connection strings, private SSH/RSA keys, hardcoded passwords, JWT secrets, and more.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kobzevvv/vibe-sec
cd vibe-sec
npm install
```

### 2. Configure

Edit `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[vars]
GITHUB_TARGET = "your-github-username"   # Who to scan
REPORT_MODE = "telegram"                  # "console" | "telegram" | "webhook"
```

Add secrets (not in wrangler.toml — use wrangler secrets):

```bash
# Optional: scan private repos too
wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN

# For Telegram alerts:
wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID

# Optional: protect /scan endpoint
wrangler secret put SCAN_SECRET
```

### 3. Create KV namespace

```bash
wrangler kv namespace create SCAN_RESULTS
# Copy the ID into wrangler.toml
```

### 4. Deploy

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

That's it. Your scanner is live at `https://vibe-sec.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`

---

## Usage

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Trigger scan | `POST /scan` (or open in browser) |
| View latest report | `GET /report` |
| Scheduled daily scan | Configured automatically via cron in `wrangler.toml` |

### Trigger via curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://vibe-sec.your-subdomain.workers.dev/scan \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-scan-secret"
```

### Scan additional domains

Add to `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[vars]
DOMAINS_TO_SCAN = "yourdomain.com,api.yourdomain.com"
AI_ENDPOINTS_TO_SCAN = "https://your-chatbot.vercel.app/api/chat"
```

## Example output

```

## Bonus: Scan your local Claude Code logs

If you use Claude Code, your session logs may contain accidentally pasted tokens or exposed domains. This local scanner reads `~/.claude/` logs and uses **Gemini 1.5 Flash** (1M token context) to analyze them for threats.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run (will prompt for Gemini API key if not set)
npm run scan-logs

# Or with key directly
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key npm run scan-logs
```

Get a free Gemini API key at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

What it scans:
- **Prompt history** — tokens/keys accidentally pasted into Claude prompts
- **Debug logs** — suspicious domains, URLs, auth activity across your sessions
- **Bash commands** — credentials that appeared in terminal commands run by Claude

Output: a Markdown threat report with findings by severity — **without reproducing the actual secret values**.

> Your logs never leave your machine. The script reads `~/.claude/` locally, extracts only security-relevant lines, and sends a filtered summary to the Gemini API.
